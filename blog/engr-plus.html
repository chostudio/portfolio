    <h1>OSU ENGR+ Strategic Course Load Guide</h1>
    <div class="seventyPercentWidth">
        <p class="publishDate"><i>Published: Dec. 10, 2023</i></p>
        <p>At Oregon State University, all first years in the College of Engineering are required to go through the
            Engineering+
            series, a set of 3 introductory engineering classes meant to be taken in Fall, Winter, and Spring term
            respectively.</p>

        <p>The School of EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) is grouped under the College of Engineering,
            meaning
            that computer science majors are not exempt and must also take it. A majority of the ENGR+ classes do not
            have computer science topics, meaning that some computer science
            majors
            may not
            even touch programming until Spring term.</p>

        <p>This guide will help you understand how to 1. Strategically set up your class load so that you can start
            taking
            Computer
            Science courses ASAP and 2. Take the more Computer Science focused ENGR+ courses.</p>
        <br>

        <p>The ENGR+ series consists of three classes:</p>

        <p><i>ENGR 100 THE OREGON STATE ENGINEERING STUDENT (3 credits)</p>
        <p>ENGR 102 DESIGN ENGINEERING AND PROBLEM SOLVING (3 credits)</p>
        <p>ENGR 103 ENGINEERING COMPUTATION AND ALGORITHMIC THINKING (3 credits)</i></p>

        <br>
        <p>However, there are ways to quicken the workload.</p>


        <h2>Part 1. Ways to Speed Up the ENGR+ Series:</h2>

        <h3>1. Take ENGR 100 & ENGR 102 Simultaenously in Fall Term.</h3>

        <p>Not many people know about this, but ENGR 100 is not a prerequisite to taking ENGR 102, meaning that you
            can
            take both of them together in the Fall Term. This allows you to take ENGR 103 a term earlier, moving up
            your
            courseload progression a term earlier too.</p>
        <p>You can see how there's no prerequisite arrow for ENGR 102 in <a
                href="https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/sites/engineering.oregonstate.edu/files/2023-10/2023-2024_cs_-_applied_-_corvallis_campus.pdf">this
                degree progression sheet.</a>
        </p>

        <h3>2. AP Computer Science A Credit can be exchanged for ENGR 103</h3>

        <p>According to <a
                href="https://admissions.oregonstate.edu/credit-opportunities">https://admissions.oregonstate.edu/credit-opportunities</a>,
            AP Computer Science A Credit covers
            CS
            160 and CS
            161, not ENGR 103. However, if you ask your advisor they can help you exchange it for ENGR 103.</p>

        <p>If you do have AP credit and are deciding whether to skip ENGR 103 or take it to review and see, I would
            highly
            recommend you do skip ENGR 103, as it assumes you have no prior programming knowledge. The next class
            (CS
            162) starts
            off with conditional if statements and loops and gradually ramps up. If you feel like you can handle
            that
            and are
            willing to start learning the C++ programming language, skip ENGR 103.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Which ENGR+ Courses Are CS Focused:</h2>

        <p>ENGR+ courses are not all the same. They all cover various engineering topics. The professor that you choose
            determines the content of the course,
            so
            make sure to
            choose a professor whose course content that sounds interesting to you.</p>

        <h3>ENGR 100</h3>

        <p>There are no ENGR 100 courses completely focused on programming.</p>

        <p><i>ENGR 100: Automating the Future: Using Sensors for Control <br>
                Learn how to solve real-world problems by designing sensors that enable signal processing devices to
                interact with the
                world autonomously. As the creator of future innovations; you start early by exploring how to solve
                real-world problems
                by thinking critically, creatively, collaborating with others, and using methods from the field of
                engineering.

                Campus: Corvallis | Instructor: Jason Clark</i></p>


        <p>Jason Clark's Automating the Future does very briefly touch upon MATLAB a little bit, but it mostly
            focuses
            on
            COMSOL, a physics simulation software. Other than that there's no programming in ENGR 100.</p>

        <h3>ENGR 102</h3>

        <p>There are some ENGR 100 courses completely focused on programming.</p>

        <p><i>ENGR 102: Solving Computational Sustainability Problems<br>
                Apply problem-solving strategies for developing algorithms to solve computational sustainability
                problems
                related to
                climate, water, energy, agriculture, forestry, and social/human factors.<br>
                Campus: Corvallis Instructor: Jennifer Parham-Mocello</i></p>

        <p>Although it is not mentioned, this course does use C++, which is good and I will expand on this reason in the
            next
            section. But
            be on the lookout, as this course may not be offered every term.</p>

        <p><i>ENGR 102: Computational Foundations in Engineering<br>
                Explore foundational engineering concepts such as design principles, usability, problem solving,
                computational
                thinking, and logic. Gain knowledge of Boolean algebra, truth tables, circuit diagrams, and Python.
                Start
                building
                skills to find a job, and boost teamwork, communication, and technical writing skills through group
                projects
                focusing on design and use of software in diverse ways.<br>
                Campus: Ecampus Instructor: Eric Vogel</i></p>

        <p>Another option is ENGR 102 with Eric Vogel as this class covers Python programming and software
            development.
            As an
            ecampus course, this should be available every term. I took this class and recommend it.</p>

        <h3>ENGR 103</h3>

        <p>ENGR 103 is meant to be an introductory programming course, being the first programming class that some
            students have
            ever taken. Different professors will teach differently. Different courses can cover different
            programming
            languages
            such as Python, C++, and I even saw one class that was taught in Java.</p>

        <p>Ideally, you should aim to choose a course taught by 1. A Computer Science focused Professor. 2. With the
            C++
            programming language.</p>

        <p>If you don't choose wisely, you may not be fully prepared to handle CS 162 Introduction to Computer
            Science
            II, the
            first CS course you take after ENGR 103. It's taught in C++ and assumes you already have some
            programming
            knowledge
            as it starts off with conditional if statements and loops.</p>



        <p>Here are some examples of ENGR 103 Courses that cover C++:</p>

        <p><i>Computational Engineering for One Planet<br>
                Familiarize yourself with core programming concepts, such as variables, expressions, conditions, control
                structures,
                functions, and simple 1-d and 2-d structures. Then put your new knowledge to the test, solving
                sustainability
                problems using computation. Programming language: C++.<br>
                Campus: Corvallis Instructor: Jennifer Parham-Mocello</p>

        <p>ENGR 103: Computational Thinking by Tinkering with Python and C++<br>
            Learn programming in Python by taking apart code examples to dissect, reverse engineer, modify, and
            adapt
            them.
            Then, solidify your understanding of the patterns you've discovered by designing new programs from
            scratch.
            Programming language: Python, with a transition to C++<br>
            Campus: Corvallis Instructor: Tim Alcon</p>

        <p>Smarter World: Internet of Things<br>
            Explore programming by seeing how the Internet of Things is built. IOT improves health, environmental
            monitoring,
            and safety. This course uses hands-on experiments using electronics and programming. Focus on creating,
            not
            just
            learning.<br>
            Programming languages: C<br>
            Campus: Corvallis Instructor: Donald Heer</p>

        <p>Interactive Physical Computing<br>
            Build interactive systems that can sense and respond to the world around you. You'll learn fundamental
            programming
            in the Arduino IDE to program CircuitPlayground boards to make light shows, songs, a smart plant, and
            handheld video
            game. Programming language: C/C++<br>
            Campus: Corvallis Instructor: Chet Udell</i></p>
        <p>If you choose not to take an ENGR 103 class with C++, that's totally okay. Personally, one of my first
            programming
            languages I learned was Python. I think it's a great programming language if you've never
            programmed
            before.
            Python is also used for a lot of modern applications (Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial
            Intelligence,
            Automation) and it's also one of the most popular programming languages for Leetcode, a
            platform
            used for coding question interview preparation. It's also not impossible to make the switch from Python
            to
            C++, but
            keep in mind you will have to eventually learn C++ for CS 162 and other classes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Keep in mind that there's a lot of different content covered depending on the professor in ENGR+ and you
            should
            choose courses that sound interesting to you and courses that will prepare you for future programming
            classes.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">As a computer science major, I hope this guide will help incoming
            computer science first-year students at OSU.</p>
